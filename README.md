- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive notebooks)
- Necessary packages (listed in project-specific requirements)

Make sure to have access to Neo4j (for the Neo4j Graphiti project) and related software if necessary.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_projects.git
```

Then navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd ai_projects
```

Install any required packages using `pip` (this may vary depending on the project):

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Projects Overview

### 1. Neo4j Graphiti Knowledge Graph

- **File:** `Neo4j_Graphiti_KG.ipynb`
- **Description:** This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the implementation of a knowledge graph using Neo4j and the Graphiti visualization tool. It explores nodes, relationships, and how to query data effectively in a graph database environment.

### 2. Agno Agentic AI

- **File:** `agno_agentic_ai`
- **Description:** This project focuses on building an agentic AI system that interacts with its environment and learns from experiences. It includes the implementation of reinforcement learning methodologies.

### 3. Book Recommender

- **File:** `book_recommender`
- **Description:** A collaborative filtering-based book recommendation system that utilizes machine learning algorithms to suggest books to users based on their preferences and reading history.

### 4. DeepSeek RAG Tutorial

- **File:** `deepseek_rag_tutorial`
- **Description:** This tutorial explores the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques using the DeepSeek library. It aims to enhance contextual AI responses by retrieving relevant information from large datasets.

## Usage

Please refer to each project's respective files for detailed instructions on how to run the notebooks, utilize the code, and understand the algorithms implemented. 

To execute the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Neo4j_Graphiti_KG.ipynb
```
